Python Student Report Generator
--------------------------------
Project Description
--

This project is a Python mini project that simulates a student report system. It demonstrates practical use of:

Lists to store student data

Loops to iterate through students

Conditional statements (if, elif, else) to assign grades and statuses

String formatting for clean and readable outputs

Math operators for score calculations and discounts

The program manages student data including names, courses, scores, and VIP status. It calculates:

Final Scores (VIP students get +5 points)

Grades (A, B, C, F)

Pass/Fail Status

VIP Status display

Additionally, it computes statistics:

Top Score

Lowest Score

Average Score

Number of Passed and Failed Students

Ranking of students by final score

Skills Demonstrated

Python lists and list operations

Loops (for) and enumerate

Conditional statements

String manipulation (strip(), title())

Formatted output with f-strings and .format()

Sorting with sorted and lambda

Basic statistics (max, min, average)
